Build a local AI pipeline that retrieves, augments, and generates answers from your own documents. You'll create a local REST API that implements the full Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, from document storage to AI-generated answers, running entirely on your machine with zero cloud costs. RAG is used to build AI assistants that answer questions from internal documents, support tickets, or product catalogs without retraining models.
